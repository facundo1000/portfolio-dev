        I started my career as a receptionist / night auditor of a 4 * hotel in
        the city of Posadas, Misiones, called Hotel HA Urbano Posadas, while I
        was studying a degree in tourism. Position in which I was from January
        2020 to June 2021.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-5 text-justify">
        I worked mainly in the reception area doing room assignment tasks,
        check-in and check-out of guests, although I also had tasks related to
        reservations, such as controlling reservation portals, helping customers
        with any inconvenience, etc.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-5 text-justify">
        While studying tourism, I began to have an interest in everything
        related to digital marketing, and digital itself. At the hotel, I
        understood that I liked solving problems (at that time related to guests
        and reservations). During the pandemic, based on studying and searching
        for information, I began to discover programming and with that, I could
        combine what I was looking for and could not find. Solving problems and
        technology, more specifically solving problems related to software.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-5 text-justify">
        I started with Java and enrolled in the degree, to have a better
        perspective of the IT world.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-5 text-justify">
        I am a curious person, who likes to solve problems, and work as a part
        of a team. I learned a lot about working as a team and being part of a
        company with guidelines and standards at the hotel.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-5 text-justify">
        I love working as a team, either independently or as a group. Valuing
        the qualities of my colleagues, and always trying to contribute to the
        whole.
